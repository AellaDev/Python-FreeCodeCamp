# Hello I am reviewing python :> Thank you FreeCodeCamp
# In python, there is no need to use special keywords in order to declare varables :>
name = 'John' # This is a str. you can use '' or "" 
age = 25 # This is an int. there is no need for quotation marks
# Variable names can't start with a number:< you can use underscore or letter instead
# It can only contain alphanumeric and numbers
# Variables are case sensitive which means age is different from Age
# You can't use reserved keywords as variable names such as if, class, def

my_name_is = 'Aella'
user_age = 22

#DO NOT use single letter for naming unless it is for the loops
# you see this?
#this is a comment
